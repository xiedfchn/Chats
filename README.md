# Chats
This is a java chat program, which is able to establish secure connection between two ends. The security is achieved by RSA, SHA and AES algorithms. In fact, the way it works is very similar to the way HTTPS connection works.

## Features
This is a program mainly aiming at achieveing secure connection. Even though, it also has a few features that the chat applications have.
- Create a connection by socket.
- Send plain messages.
- Send pictures
- Change to secure mode and comunicating securely.

## Requirements

NetBeans

## How it works

I do recommend to learn about RSA, SHA and AES. And how Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity and Digital Signature can be achieved before reading the picture below.
